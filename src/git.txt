If git was not there:

1. Collaboration of multiple developers working in same project.
2. Accidental deletion of project recovery was not possible.
3. Reverting the code back to certain date is impossible.
4. Creating separate copy of the project for new feature and after completion of the feature merging it back
to original code is nearly impossible.
5. Sharing the code takes alot of time eg : uploading to drive and downloading from drive
